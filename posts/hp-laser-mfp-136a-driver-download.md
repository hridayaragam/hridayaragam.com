HP provides drivers for their devices to ensure seamless printing, scanning, and copying functions. The HP Laser MFP 136a driver specifically enables these features while ensuring that the printer runs efficiently and with optimal performance.

This includes having enough system memory (RAM) and processing power, especially if your work involves handling large documents or high-resolution images. Checking the compatibility of both your operating system and hardware ensures that you can exploit the printer’s features to the fullest without encountering glitches or slowdown.
