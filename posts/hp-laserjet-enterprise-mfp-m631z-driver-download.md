This ensures that documents are printed as expected, without any loss of quality. The correct installation of the printer driver not only optimizes printing performance but also enhances the overall functionality of the printer, allowing you to utilize features such as double-sided printing, scanning, and copying.

In some cases, printer drivers can also include additional features or utilities, such as maintenance tools or printer status monitors, which can help keep you informed about the printer's operation and any potential issues. Properly managing these features can drastically improve the user experience.
