When you purchase the HP OfficeJet Pro 9720e Wide Format printer, ensuring the correct drivers are installed is crucial for optimal performance. This article focuses on two essential driver files that enhance the printer's functionality: the HP OfficeJet Pro 9720e Wide Format Full Feature Drivers and Software, and the Universal Scan driver. Each of these drivers is designed to enable specific features of the printer and is compatible with a range of Windows operating systems.

## The Full Feature Driver: Unlocking Your Printer's Potential

The HP OfficeJet Pro 9720e Wide Format Full Feature Drivers and Software is a comprehensive installation package that facilitates all the printer's capabilities. It includes the necessary device drivers to enable printing, scanning, and faxing. The file size is approximately 493.62 MB, which may seem substantial, but this comprehensive package ensures that all features are accessible, providing you with the best user experience.

With the full feature driver, users can benefit from advanced printing options, such as double-sided printing, borderless printing, and high-quality photo prints. Additionally, this driver opens up scan-to-email and scan-to-Microsoft applications functionalities, allowing users to send documents directly from the printer to their chosen software without the need for a computer intermediary.

## The Universal Scan Driver: Keeping It Simple

Complementing the full feature driver is the HP OfficeJet Pro 9720e Wide Format Universal Scan driver. This driver is more specialized and focuses primarily on enabling scanning capabilities without being tied to additional print functionalities. With a file size of approximately 439.56 MB, it serves as a streamlined option for those who may not require printing or faxing features but still wish to utilize the scanner.

The Universal Scan driver supports both Windows 11 and Windows 10, as well as Windows 8.1, across 64-bit and 32-bit versions. By installing this driver, users can enjoy straightforward scanning without the additional complexities that come with the full feature driver, making it an ideal choice for those who primarily need digital copies of documents.

## Operating System Compatibility: A Tailored Experience

Both driver packages cater to a variety of Windows operating systems. The full feature driver supports Windows 11, 10, and 7 in both 32-bit and 64-bit editions, allowing for widespread compatibility among users with older machines as well as new systems. This versatility means individuals and businesses that rely on various Windows environments can easily enjoy the full suite of functionalities provided by the printer.

Conversely, the Universal Scan driver extends its compatibility to Windows 11, 10, and 8.1 (both 32 and 64-bit), making it flexible enough to accommodate a broad spectrum of users, even those using slightly older systems. This heightened area of support is something to consider if speed and ease of setup are your primary concerns.
